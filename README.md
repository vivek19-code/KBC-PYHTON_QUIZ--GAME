# KBC-PYHTON_QUIZ--GAME
This is my First project.In this project, I have made a simple KBC Game in Python which let's you ask some of the questions, and you'll be given four options for that. In this game, one 50-50 lifeline is there, which you can use to skip two wrong options out of four. You can use this lifeline only once. You have to choose the correct option else you will lost the match. Here, you'll also earn rewards as you would move forward. To improve the features of this game, I have done code with help of python, which let speak all the text, that you wanna play, showing the replica of the original KBC Game.
